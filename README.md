# codekata

This is a repository of various projects for code katas. Each kata project will have its own directory structure, usually following the Maven project structure, and a ``devnotes.md`` file. This file will be updated with notes made as work on the kata progresses.

To follow the progress of work on a kata, view the history of the project's main directory. This way, you can see all the files that were changed in each commit. Any new text in the ``devnotes.md`` file as shown in the history view will pertain to the changes made to other files in the same commit.
